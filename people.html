          <h2>Coordination, Design, and Implementation Group</h2>
          <p><em>This group oversees the project in terms of design and coding decisions.</em>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Patrick Rashleigh</strong> (Project Lead and Principle Investigator) is the Data Visualization Coordinator at the Brown University Library, where he engages in the production and dissemination of visual modes of scholarly communication and analysis. In practice, this means working with faculty, students, and colleagues on visually-oriented projects and holding instruction sessions on visualization tools and techniques. He also currently oversees the Library’s Digital Studio, which features a display wall, AV recording suite, and 3D printing facilities. Patrick holds an MA in Ethnomusicology from York University and a BA in English Literature from the University of British Columbia.</p>
          <p><strong>Joseph Rhoads</strong> (Digital Repository and Implementation Advisor) is the Digital Repository Manager at Brown University. He oversees the development of the Brown Digital Repository (BDR) and supports its mission as “... a place to gather, index, store, preserve, and make available digital assets produced via the scholarly, instructional, research, and administrative activities at Brown.” Joseph holds an MS in Mathematics (Biomedical Mathematics Program) from Florida State, an MS in Industrial and Applied Mathematics from RIT, and a BS in Computational Mathematics, also from RIT. </p>
          <p><strong>Crystal Brusch</strong> (User Interface Advisor) is the Designer for Online Publications as part of the Library's Mellon-funded Digital Publishing Initiative. Crystal joined Brown in the fall of 2016 to help craft dynamic digital publications that highlight faculty scholarship. Her work focuses on web design, interactive storytelling, user experience, and animation. Crystal’s past roles include work in publishing, journalism, and a government program to support local artists. Crystal has an MA in Interactive Telecommunications from New York University and a BA in English from Florida State University.

Ben has a background in graphic design, concentrating in “sociology of aesthetics” as an undergraduate at Hampshire College, and digital librarianship (MLIS from University of Rhode Island). Ben’s non-library design work has focused on independent publishing (with presses such as Wave Books).
          </p>
          <p><strong>Programmer, External Hire</strong> (Selective implementation and consulting) will consult during the planning phase and be used for selective programming as identified by the development plan (some application parts will be developed using Library expertise and student programmers).
          </p>
          <h2>Community Advisors and Pilot Participants</h2>
          <p><em>This group acts as testers and content creators (in partnership with Brown Library
        student programmers). Each pilot covers a different domain application: classroom activity
        design, digital exhibit, digital repository display.</em>
          </p>
          <p><strong>James F. Egan</strong> (Pedagogical pilot) is Professor of English and Interim Director of the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage. Professor Egan came to Brown in 1991 after receiving his PhD from the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1999, he published Authorizing Experience: Refigurations of the Body Politic in Seventeenth-Century New England Writing.

He has a PhD from the University of Minnesota, an MS from Eastern Illinois University and a BSc from the University of Wales, UK.</p>
          <p><strong>Student content developers</strong> will work with our pilot participants to generate content in the framework.</p>
          <h2>Website and Documentation Group</h2>
          <p><em>The web presence and documentation will be critical to the development of a community
        around the application.</em>
